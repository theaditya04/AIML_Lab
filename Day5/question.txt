absolute error
sum of squared errors


the sample error of the hypothesis F to target function (c) and data sample (S) is 
True error : the true error if denoted by the error(P) of F and distribution(D) is the probability that h will is classified an instance drawn at random according to d. 

Choosing the correct decision tree?
Prefer a tree which is small in depth.,
In order to do that , we have to devise an algorithm that will search the space of decision trees and come up with a small tree(NP-Hard problem) 
we have to look for greedy algorithm .

We can grow the tree such that every subtree has a specific value of class level or we can stop at a point where the probability of one possible class level is high
